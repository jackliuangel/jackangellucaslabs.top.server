# Project Rules and Constraints

## 1. Remote Server Access (lightsail)
- This repository runs on a remote server named **lightsail**.
- Access the server using: `ssh lightsail`.
- **Performance Constraints:**
  - The server is low-performance.
  - **DISABLE `scp`**: Do not use `scp` to transfer files.
  - **NO heavy bash code**: Avoid complex or resource-intensive shell scripts.
  - **Single Session Only**: Do not attempt to open more than one SSH session simultaneously.

## 2. Directory Structure & Debugging
- The repository mimics the remote server's file system structure (e.g., `/var`, `/tmp`, `/etc`).
- When debugging on the remote server, always compare the local repository path with the corresponding remote path.
- Local repo root maps to the primary application directory on the server.

## 3. Communication and Artifacts
- All generated Markdown (`.md`) and shell script (`.sh`)files and documentation should be stored in the `/chat-artifacts` directory within this repository.
- Avoid cluttering the root or other functional directories with chat logs or temporary documentation unless specified.
